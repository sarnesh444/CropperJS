## Objective:

#### As a part of the 30 days of code challenge I wanted to build an OCR chrome extension,since the user should be able to capture and crop the screen,I wanted to test the working of cropper.js 

I found out a simple,easy way to implement this instead of writing your own code use the cropper.js library. 

## Tools used

* [CropperJS](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/) A JavaScript library to crop images with ease.

* The bread and butter HTMl,CSS,JS

## Editor used:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - I would totally recommend Atom IDE if you are just getting started with web-dev like me.
